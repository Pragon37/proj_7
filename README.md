# Proj_7 :Investment optimization

[Project 7](https://github.com/Pragon37/proj_7)

This project provides two programs to compute the best investement selection:
1-One based on a brute force algorithm
2-Another based on the "Knapsack algorithm" 

## Installing / Getting started

It is implemented as a python program. To setup the environment you need to execute the following instructions:

```shell
python -m venv env
env/Scripts/activate
python bruteforce.py
python optimized.py
```

bruteforce.py computes the investment for the first set of data (dataset 0).It cannot process neither dataset 1 nor dataset 2.
optimized.py computes the investment for dataset 1 (Enter 1), dataset 2 (Enter 2), dataset 0 (default)

## Developing


```shell
git clone https://github.com/Pragon37/proj_7
cd proj_7/
```
